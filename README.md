# Rocket-Patrol-Mod
A modification of the Rocket Patrol Copy I made before

This is more for explaining the edits I made to the game. 
- Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change it's theme/aesthetic to something other than sci-fi (60 points)
      -I redesigned the artwork to look more like a little arcade game where you throw a ball at sheeps of different colors. I changed the background to a more mountain
       like feel. I added little red targets on them to make the point. I also changed the sounds to different ones with more coin pick ups. 
- Parallax Scrolling (10 points)
      - the Parallax Scrolling has three layers. the base in the very back which is a solid color with the sun just hangout out in there with a smiley face and 
        then we have the seond layer on top whcih is a mountian with the ground heading in one direction. the third layer is the brown layers in the very front going in the 
        oposite direction. so that's what I did for the Parallax scrolling. 
- Create New Spaceship type (that's smaller, faster, and worth more Points) (20 Points)
      - I added the golden goat which just appears every now and then which is worth more points than the sheep and just qucikly zooms across the screen.
        With the latest intiration the golden goat just doesn't appear for some reason. Hopefully you can see it when it's up but Idk, just not showing up.
      - This one is worth 50 points, the pink sheep is 10, the grey sheep is 20, and the brown sheep is 30. For whatever reason the farther the sheep, the more points it has.
      - The goat just doesn't appear at the moment I don't think I get the points counted for this. The goat is on the homescreen as well, you can see them on the side. 
- Add your own music to PLay Scene (5 Points)
      - There is this artist I like a lot called Nihilore and they have music that can be used, shared, and copied as long as you provide proper credit and a link to the license. 
      - http://www.nihilore.com/license <this also links to the website, or rather just the words for it since it's a read me. 
      - I didn't make the movie though so I'm not sure this actually counts for it.....
